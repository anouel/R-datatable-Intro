# Re-creating the Workshop Materials.

Run the [_make.R](https://github.com/saghirb/R-datatable-Intro/blob/master/_make.R) 
script in the R console.

# Why `data.table`?

- `data.table` is a great, high quality and well maintained package with a strong
development team.
- It is **fast** and **memory efficient**. 
    + Including reading and writing data.
- It has no dependencies and works out of the box :)
- Knowing `data.table` will increase your knowledge and understanding of R.
    + I think it is a must have (or must know about) package in your R tool kit.
    + Be brave give it a go :)
